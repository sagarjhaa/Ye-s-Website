Since regular flooding along Yellow River is a huge and long-lasting environmental issue in the central region of China, the hydrological dynamics of the river system have long been monitored and studied by the National Governance Committee of Yellow River, and a huge deposit of environmental data of the watershed has been developed. As an academic collaborator of the Committee, Dr. Zhao’s research has great significance in developing further understanding and knowledge of this unique ecological and environmental system and finding geospatial solutions to alleviate flooding threats to the local communities.</p>
